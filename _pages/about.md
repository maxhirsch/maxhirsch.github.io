I am an undergraduate senior at Carnegie Mellon in the Honors Math Program. I will be starting a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley in the fall as a NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

In Fall 2022, I studied abroad at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, where I was doing research in the Computational Mathematics and Simulation Sciences group.

My interests include:
- Numerical Methods for PDEs
- Structure-Preserving Reduced Order Models
- Theoretical Machine Learning
