I am a first year Applied Math PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Prof. Franziska Weber. 

**Education:**
* M.S. Mathematical Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University
* B.S. Mathematical Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University

In Fall 2022, I studied abroad at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, where I was doing research in the Computational Mathematics and Simulation Sciences group of Prof. Jan S. Hesthaven.

**My interests include:**
- Numerical Methods for PDEs
- Structure-Preserving Reduced Order Models
- Theoretical Machine Learning
