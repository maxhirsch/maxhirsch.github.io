I am a third year Applied Math PhD Candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Prof. Franziska Weber. 

Check out [MLniCS](https://github.com/MLniCS/MLniCS), a library for creating physics-informed neural networks for parameterized reduced order models which I contribute to!

**Education:**
* M.S. Mathematical Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University
* B.S. Mathematical Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University

**My mathematical research interests include:**
- Numerical Methods for PDEs
- Optimization
- Machine Learning for Scientific Computing
- Reduced Order Models
- Applications to Liquid Crystals and Fluids
